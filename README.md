# Development Environment

I used google to learn and to get answer to my questions, I also used chatgpt to fix some sintax problems and to fix an exception problem.

{I used C# to do this code)

# Future Work

- I need to do something that will use libraries 
- I need to test more my logical knowledge
- I need to be more creative with my project
